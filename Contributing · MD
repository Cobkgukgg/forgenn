# Contributing

Thanks for wanting to contribute! Here's the deal:

## Found a bug?

Just open an issue. Include:
- What you were trying to do
- What happened instead  
- Code to reproduce it
- Your Python version

## Want to add something?

Cool. Here's the process:

1. Fork it
2. Make a branch: `git checkout -b feature/cool-thing`
3. Do your thing
4. Add tests if needed
5. Make sure existing tests pass: `python tests/test_neuralforge.py`
6. Push it: `git push origin feature/cool-thing`
7. Open a PR

## Code style

Keep it clean:
- Follow PEP 8 (mostly)
- Add docstrings to public stuff
- Use type hints where it makes sense
- Keep lines under 100 chars
- Meaningful variable names (no `x1`, `x2`, `temp`)

Example:
```python
def forward(self, input_data: np.ndarray, training: bool = True) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Forward pass through the layer.
    
    Args:
        input_data: Input tensor
        training: Whether in training mode
        
    Returns:
        Output after forward pass
    """
    pass
```

## Commit messages

- Use present tense: "Add feature" not "Added feature"
- First line under 72 chars
- Reference issues if relevant
